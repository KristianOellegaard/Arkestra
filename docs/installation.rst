Requirements

Arkestra requires a working installation of `Django CMS <http://django-cms.org/>`_.

Django CMS has its own installation requirements; installing Django CMS will ensure that most of the components required by Arkestra are also installed.

In addition, Akestra requires installation of:

* BeautifulSoup
* django-typogrify
* pyquery
* the Semantic Presentation Editor

Arkestra itself can be obtained from `GitHub <https://github.com/evildmp/Arkestra/>`_.
