Django CMS
==========

Arkestra requires a working installation of `Django CMS <http://django-cms.org/>`_.

Django CMS has its own installation requirements; installing Django CMS will ensure that most of the components required by Arkestra are also installed.

You'll need to follow `Django CMS's installation instructions <https://www.django-cms.org/en/documentation/>`; do that first, before installing Arkestra.
