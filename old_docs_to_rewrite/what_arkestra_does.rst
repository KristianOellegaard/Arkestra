Key modules

Contacts & people
=================

Arkestra is an institutional CMS. It maintains and publishes information about people and their relationships with the entities they belong to, and the relationships between institutions and their parts.

News & events
=============

Arkestra holds information about whatâ€™s on, including information about how important news and events items are, and their relevance to different parts of the institution.

The Semantic Presentation editor
================================

As well as maintaining semantic information rather than just mere data at the highest levels, Arkestra does the same at the level of content editing.

Arkestra has a unique editor, based on the WYMEditor, that:

* creates complex, flexible, multiple-column layouts
* requires no knowledge of HTML/CSS
* creates and enforces well-structured semantic HTML

No other web editor can meet more than two of those criteria.

==========
Django CMS
==========

Arkestra integrates with the architecture of `Django CMS <http://django-cms.org/>`_.

Arkestra requires Django CMS, and can be installed alongside an existing Django CMS project without affecting it in any way.
